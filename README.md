## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require spatie/laravel-remote
```

You can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\Remote\RemoteServiceProvider" --tag="remote-config"
```

This is the contents of the published config file:

```php
return [
    /*
     * This host will be used if none is specified
     * when executing the `remote` command.
     */
    'default_host' => 'default',

    /*
     * Here you can define the hosts where the commands should be executed.
     */
    'hosts' => [
        'default' => [
            'host' => env('REMOTE_HOST'),

            'port' => env('REMOTE_PORT', 22),

            'user' => env('REMOTE_USER'),

            /*
             * The package will cd to the given path before executing the given command.
             */
            'path' => env('REMOTE_PATH'),
        ]
    ],
];
```

## Usage

To execute a command on the remote server use the `remote` Artisan command. You can pass any artisan command that you would like to execute on the server.

Here's an example where we clear the cache.

```bash
php artisan remote cache:clear
```

### Executing raw commands

If you want to execute a bash command, use the `--raw` option.

Here we will get a list of files on the server.

```bash
php artisan remote ls --raw
```

### Executing bash script

If you want to execute a bash script, use the `--script` option.

You need to provide a path to the script as an argument .

```bash
php artisan remote --script ../path/local-script.sh
```

### Using another host

You can define hosts in the config file. By default, the `default` host is used. To execute a command on another host use the `--host` option.

```bash
php artisan remote cache:clear --host=my-other-host
```

### Using options in remote commands

If you need to use flags or options in the command you're trying to execue, you can wrap the entire command in quotes:

```bash
php artisan remote --raw "ls -a"
```

## Testing

```bash
composer test
```
